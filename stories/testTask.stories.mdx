# Test task

Below you will see a test task instructions that you need to complete step by step.
The meaning of the test problem is to understand how quickly you will master the Storybook and implement the code in TS. –êlso test your knowledge about react

## Create a simple "Table Component" for posts

Table should contain `ID`, `Title`, `Description` and `Actions` columns.
Columns you need take from component props (`posts={...}`).
For your table you can use data:
```sh
[
  {id: '#1254', title: 'News 15.08.2021', description: 'Some test description 1'},
  {id: '#1255', title: 'News 17.08.2021', description: 'Some test description 2'},
  {id: '#1256', title: 'News 20.08.2021', description: 'Some test description 3'}
]
```

Each post item should have `Copy` and `Remove` buttons under actions columns,
"Table componnent" Should have `onChange={...}` prop witch one will be trigerrend on every item removal or copiing and return changed array of ALL posts.
State for posts array should be saved in `stories.tsx` file.
When you click on `Copy` button you need to add copy of that post below and generate unique id for it

## Add form to be able to create a new Posts

For post creation you need to have 2 inputs: `title` and `description`. `id` should be generated. After form submit you need to trigger `onChange` prop.

## Add new prop for "Table Component" to disable actions

You need to add a new prop `porle` and it can take only 2 values 
`role="admin"` or `role="viewer"`. If role is viewer you need to hide table `Actions` column.
You need to be able to change `role` by Storybook `Controls`
